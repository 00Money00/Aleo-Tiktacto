# Overview
Welcome to the Leo programming language. Leo is a functional, statically-typed programming language built for writing private applications.

The syntax of Leo is influenced by JavaScript, Python, Scala, and Rust with a strong emphasis on readability and ease-of-use.

Leo exists to provide a simple high-level language that compiles to a rank one constraint system (R1CS) circuit. With Leo, you can write circuits to support zero-knowledge tokens, private stable coins, and decentralized marketplaces.
