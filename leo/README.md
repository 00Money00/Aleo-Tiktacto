# Overview

This directory contains the source code for the Leo command line interface.  
For a comprehensive list of commands and usage see the [developer documentation](https://developer.aleo.org/developer/cli/overview).

The `leo-errors` and `leo-package` modules are also included in this directory for convenience.
However, they are also used throughout the `compiler/` directory and `leo-compiler` module.
