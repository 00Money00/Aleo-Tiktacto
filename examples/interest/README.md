# interest.aleo

This program calculates interest over a fixed number of periods.

We note that the Leo code is much more readable and writable than the
corresponding Aleo code, which can be seen in `build/main.aleo` after building.

## Build Guide

To compile this Aleo program, run:
```bash
aleo build
```
