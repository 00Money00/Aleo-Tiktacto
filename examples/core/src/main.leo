// This function takes as input a field `a` and calls several core circuit functions.
// Core circuit functions are built-in to the Leo language and call handwritten, optimized circuits in the AVM.
// To call a core circuit function, use the correct capitalized circuit identifier followed by two colons
// and then the function. Example: `Pedersen64::hash()`.
